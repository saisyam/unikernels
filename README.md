# Unikernels
Unikernels are specialised, single-address-space machine images constructed by using library operating systems. Refer to [http://unikernel.org/](http://unikernel.org/) 

In this repo we will explore different unikernel implementations. To start with we build and deploy unikernels from [nanos](https://nanos.org/). Nanos builds images for AWS, GCP and Azure. We build, mostly, Python and Java related images and test them on different cloud providers.
